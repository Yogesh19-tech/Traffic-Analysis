# 🚗 Traffic Satisfaction Analysis and Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes transport satisfaction data using Python and machine learning techniques.  
It explores demographic and travel-related factors affecting passenger satisfaction through visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
Classification models such as **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** are implemented to predict overall satisfaction levels.
